Frequently mistaken for Sasquatch, Paul Bunyan and Jesus. I have tattoos of all of my brothers and sisters. I am an only child. Perpetual sleep talker. I am a gadget guy- anything new in technology intrigues me, but I also get stoked on simple things like slipping googly eyes onto people’s Keurigs. Routine bores me.  I have a seven foot bean bag chair and a five pound dog.  Many people like to call themselves night owls or morning people but I’m both. I will dance around the kitchen screaming about weiners and two minutes later have a serious heart to heart. I’m a bit of a paradox.  Wrestlemania is my favorite holiday and I will always use it as an excuse to travel across the country.

    I am good at making boring things fun. My heart is not dead, I bring enthusiasm and energy into taking out the trash. I constantly make up songs about anything and everything. Give me seven ingredients and I will be your master chef. I am quick to take on new challenges in order to better myself.  I am never not working on some kind of wacky side project.  I will continue to follow my curiosity through life, it has got me this far and I have no complaints.
